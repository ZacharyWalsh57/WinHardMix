# WinHardMix
A Wireless Hardware Mixer for Windows 10

This is kinda an old project now for me. But, I will point out that to use this project: 
- Burn an ESP12F with the ESP12F Sketch found under version 3.0 under ATMEGA328P Mixer.
- Then burn an ATMEGA (Arduino) with the master sketch (See the code for where pots go an such)
- Open up the python script and run it. 
- Hook up the arduino to your PC. DO NOT OPEN THE SERIAL MONITOR!
- Adjust the pots and watch the volumes change.
